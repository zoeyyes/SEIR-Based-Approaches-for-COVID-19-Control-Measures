		  <td data-title="Purpose">To explore the efficiency of social distancing </td>
		  <td data-title="Summary">The study shows that implementing lockdown and social distancing together leads to an effective strategy to control the spread of COVID-19, and stricter social distancing measures result in a significantly better outcome. However, long-term closures are unrealistic, so different reopening strategies are simulated. The simulations inidcate that reopening with social distancing measures in place is the most efficient strategy. </td>

			<td data-title="Source">Nature</td>
			<td data-title="Purpose">To explore the application of extended SEIR model </td>
			<td data-title="Summary">The model includes different groups with varying parameters and behavioral responses to interventions, allowing for a more precise analysis of the efficiency of measures. Results show trade-offs between control goals and suggest a combination of tailored measures and 'trace and isolate' approaches to keep severe infections and death tolls low. Mild social distancing combined with high take-up rates for tracing apps can control the epidemic in the medium run, but rigorous control measures will need to be continued until a vaccine is widely available. </td>

			<td data-title="Source">Nature</td>
			<td data-title="Purpose">To analyze the relationship between mobility and transmission of COVID-19</td>
			<td data-title="Summary">The results showed that transmission significantly decreased with the initial reduction in mobility in most countries, but the relationship between transmission and mobility weakened after the relaxation of strict control measures. Mobility explained a significant proportion of the variation in transmissibility, and countries with ongoing social distancing behaviors had lower transmission rates after control measures were relaxed. The study highlights the importance of social distancing interventions in controlling the spread of COVID-19. </td>

The results indicate that these measures could be effective in curbing the transmission of viral respiratory diseases and potentially reducing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. </td>

			<td data-title="Summary">This study measures the impact of social distancing measures on reducing contacts in the UK population during the COVID-19 pandemic. It found that the measures led to a reduction of 74% in the total number of contacts per person, which is consistent with other reports from the UK. If similar changes occur across the UK population, the basic reproduction number would be below 1 (0.62; 95% CI 0.37&#8208;0.89), indicating a decline in cases in the coming weeks.</td>
